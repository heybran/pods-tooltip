## Pods Tooltip

(Work in progess) A possible solution to simplify tooltip for [Pods Framework](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods).

### Usage

  <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <p>Capabilities denote access to specific functionality in WordPress, and are assigned to specific User Roles. Please see the Roles and Capabilities component in Pods for an easy tool to add your own capabilities and roles.</p>
  <a href="/some-url">Find out more >></a>
</pods-tooltip>
```

```html
<pods-tooltip>
  <p>A short descriptive summary of what the post type is.</p>
</pods-tooltip>
```
